# Email Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of two distinct email marketing campaigns for an e-commerce company, identified as "Campaign A" and "Campaign B". It compares traditional email content with interactive and personalized content to determine which is more effective in engaging customers.

## Features
- Analysis of email open rates, click rates, and purchase amounts for each campaign.
- Statistical testing to evaluate the significance of differences between the campaigns.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- SciPy for statistical tests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- SciPy

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

2. Install required libraries:


### Usage
Execute the main script from the project directory:


## Data
Place the `email_marketing.csv` dataset in the `Data` folder. The dataset should include the campaign type, email open rate, click rate, and purchase amount columns.

## Detailed Instructions

1. **Install Only Required Libraries and Tests**
   - Ensure that only the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `scipy`) and any specific tests you plan to conduct are installed in your working environment.

2. **Load the Dataset**
   - Load `email_marketing.csv` into your working environment to begin analysis.

3. **Initial Impressions from the Data**
   a. Display the first and last 10 rows of the dataset to get an overview.
   b. Comment on any notable aspects within the groups you are comparing, such as average values.

4. **Conduct Statistical Tests at 1% Significance Level**
   a. Determine the assumptions that need to be tested to decide on the correct statistical test. If unnecessary, skip testing the assumption.
   b. Perform the final tests and display the results.
   c. Interpret the business problem considering the final test results.

5. **Re-evaluate Results at 5% Significance Level**
   - Reinterpret the results obtained in question 4 at a 5% significance level. Only repeat the tests you deem necessary, or copy the results from question 4 and add your comments below.

## Results
The analysis results, including statistical tests, will be printed to the console. Use these results to make informed decisions about email marketing strategies.
